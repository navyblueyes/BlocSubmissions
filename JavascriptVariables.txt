####Questions

>What type of variable name casing do you use in JavaScript? (think of snakes or camels)

A:   camelCase

>If you want to create a variable called mentor and set its value equal to the name of your mentor, how would you do that?

A:    `var myMentor = “Michael”;`

>How would you then log the value of mentor to the console?

A:    `console.log(myMentor);`

>Describe the difference between let, var, and const.

A:    `let` refers to local variable (good for loops, conditionals and mathematical programas); `var` refers to global variables that you want to use across functions and other levels of scope; `const` is a variable that shouldn’t be changed.

####Code Practice


var name = 'Michael';
const hair = 'blonde hair';

function introduce(){
  let state = "California";
  if(typeof state !== 'undefined'){          
  home = "lives in " + state + ". ";
  console.log("This is " + name + ", who has " + hair + " and " + home);
  }
}
